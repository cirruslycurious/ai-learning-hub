# AI Learning Hub

A personal system for tracking AI/GenAI learning resources, tutorials, and projects.

## Why This Exists

I keep finding great resources, tutorials, and project ideas — then losing them in browser tabs, chat histories, and forgotten bookmarks. This is a place to capture, organize, and track everything related to my AI learning journey.

## Features (Planned)

- **Resource Library**: Podcasts, blogs, YouTube channels, Substacks, subreddits, people to follow
- **Tutorial Tracker**: Tutorials and walkthroughs to learn from, with progress tracking
- **Project Tracker**: My own projects — what I'm building, status, tech used, learnings

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React + Vite |
