# React Development Rules

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Co-locate tests with components (*.test.tsx)

## State Management
- Use React Query for server state
- Use Zustand for client state (stores/)
- Avoid prop drilling - use context for shared state

## Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Keep styles co-located with components

## TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types without justification
- Use shared types from @ai-learning-hub/types

## Testing
- Unit tests for component logic
- Integration tests for user flows
- Use React Testing Library
- Test user behavior, not implementation details

## File Organization
```
/frontend/src/
  /components/     # Reusable UI components
  /features/       # Feature-specific components
  /hooks/          # Custom React hooks
  /stores/         # Zustand state stores
  /utils/          # Frontend utilities
  /types/          # Frontend-specific types
```

## Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (UserProfile.tsx)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (useAuth.ts)
- Utils: camelCase (formatDate.ts)
- Tests: same name with .test suffix (UserProfile.test.tsx)
