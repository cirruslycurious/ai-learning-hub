# Epic 0: Project Foundation

> **Status**: In Progress
> **Goal**: Establish project foundation — repo, specs, PRD — before writing any code.

## Why This Epic

We're doing spec-driven development. This epic ensures we have a solid PRD, clear user stories, and testable acceptance criteria before any implementation begins.

## Issues in This Epic

Create these as GitHub Issues:

### Setup
- [ ] **Issue #1**: Create repo structure and CLAUDE.md ✅ *(you're doing this now)*
- [ ] **Issue #2**: Set up GitHub project board for tracking

### Persona & Problems
- [ ] **Issue #3**: Draft persona document (interview myself)
- [ ] **Issue #4**: Document problem statements with specific failure modes
- [ ] **Issue #5**: Define jobs to be done

### User Stories

- [ ] **Issue #7**: Write user stories — Tutorial Tracker
- [ ] **Issue #8**: Write user stories — Project Tracker
- [ ] **Issue #9**: Write user stories — Quick Capture (cross-cutting)

### Finalization
- [ ] **Issue #10**: Define MVP scope and cut line
- [ ] **Issue #11**: Define success metrics
- [ ] **Issue #12**: Write technical constraints and architecture doc
- [ ] **Issue #13**: Final PRD review and sign-off

## Acceptance Criteria for This Epic

- [ ] PRD is complete with no TODOs
- [ ] Every feature traces back to a job-to-be-done
- [ ] Every job-to-be-done traces back to a real problem
- [ ] User stories have testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] MVP scope is clearly defined

## Exit Criteria

This epic is DONE when:
1. PRD is reviewed and "signed off" (committed with no open questions)
2. Epic 1 (Project Setup / Infrastructure) is ready to begin
